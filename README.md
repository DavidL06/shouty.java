# Shouty

Shouty is a social networking application for short physical distances.
When someone shouts, only people within 1000m can hear it.

Shouty doesn't exist yet - you will implement it yourself!

That is, if you're attending a BDD/Cucumber course.

## Get the code

Git:

    git clone https://github.com/cucumber-ltd/shouty.java.git
    cd shouty.java

Subversion:

    svn checkout https://github.com/cucumber-ltd/shouty.java/branches/master shouty.java
    cd shouty.java

Or simply [download](https://github.com/cucumber-ltd/shouty.java/releases) a zip or tarball.
