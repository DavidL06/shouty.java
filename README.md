# Shouty

Shouty is a social networking application for short physical distances.
When someone shouts, only people within 1000m can hear it.

Shouty doesn't exist yet - you will implement it yourself!

That is, if you're attending a BDD/Cucumber course.

## You will need

1. A Java IDE (e.g. Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA)
2. Java 1.8 JDK
3. Maven

## Get the code

Git:

    git clone https://github.com/cucumber-ltd/shouty.java.git
    cd shouty.java

Subversion:

    svn checkout https://github.com/cucumber-ltd/shouty.java/branches/master shouty.java
    cd shouty.java

Or simply [download](https://github.com/cucumber-ltd/shouty.java/releases) a zip and expand it into a directory on your computer.

## Import the project

In Eclipse:

File > Import > Existing Maven Project

Then browse to the directory where you downloaded shouty.java and you should see the project start importing.

In IntelliJ

File > Import project

Then browse to the `pom.xml` file in the directory where you downloaded shouty.java

##Â Run the tests

In Eclipse:

Right-click the project > Run as > Maven test

In IntelliJ

Right-click the project > Run > All tests
